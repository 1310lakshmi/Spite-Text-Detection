# Spite-Text-Detection
ABSTRACT
Spite Text Detection is an automation model, to analyse the polarity of various comments and tweets in Twitter.
This model analyses the efficiencies of various algorithms in classifying the given tweet. 
In this project, the given comment is classified into three main classes. Classes considering here are neutral, offensive, and hate speech. 
In this procedure different functions and modules execute the steps of classification. 
This model takes a labelled data which includes the tweet and the class it belongs to and this dataset is fed into multiple machine learning algorithms. 
This model uses different machine learning algorithms such as KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours), SVM (Support Vector Machine), Logistic Regression and Random forest. 
This model evaluates the performance of each algorithm applied on given input file which is data set of tweets.
